/**
 * The current version of the upstash-lua library.
 * Follows semantic versioning (semver).
 *
 * This constant is useful for:
 * - Debugging: knowing which version is in use
 * - Logging: including version in log messages
 * - Compatibility checks: comparing versions programmatically
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { VERSION } from "upstash-lua"
 * console.log(`Using upstash-lua v${VERSION}`)
 * ```
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
